Discussion Questions

Recursion

1.  Recursion consists of multiple calls to the same function, with each function call being dependent on following function call to resolve.

2.  Designating a base case prevents infinite recursion.


Graphs

1.  A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. 

2.  All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees. Unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles and can be non-directed.

3.  Academic paper citations could be modeled using a graph.
